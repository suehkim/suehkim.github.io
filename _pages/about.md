Hi, I’m **Suehyun Kim (김수현)**.

I am a master’s student in Statistics at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), working under the supervision of Professor [Kwonsang Lee](https://www.kwonsanglee.com/). My current research focuses on causal inference, exploring both its theoretical aspects and practical applications. My specific interests encompass, but are not limited to, the following topics:
- Robust estimation of causal effects.
- Causal inference in complex datasets: non-iid, non-Euclidean, high dimensional.
- Generalizability and transportability.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics at Seoul National University, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematical theory and gained early research experience.

If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please don’t hesitate to reach out: [suehyunkim@snu.ac.kr](mailto:suehyunkim@snu.ac.kr)
